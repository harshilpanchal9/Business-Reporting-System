Blingalytics
============

Blingalytics is an open-source Python project for building a flexible,
powerful business reporting system.

* Define new reports quickly by writing simple Python

* Pluggable data source infrastructure â€” use the built-in modules or write
  one for your own particular needs

* Powerful caching system allows for fast and easy sorting and paging

Whatever business initiatives and performance indicators you want to look at,
Blingalytics offers the tools you need to slice and dice your data. Maybe you
want to see the number of retweets your clients get over time. Or maybe you
simply want to track your revenue and other financial indicators. Perhaps you
need to track how many virtual tractors your virtual farmers are purchasing.
Blingalytics can probably help.

For the full documentation, please visit it over on `Read the Docs`_. Or if
you're feeling particularly do-it-yourself today, you can always build the
docs yourself with Sphinx_.
